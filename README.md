### **Dependencies & Applications**

This project leverages Python version 3.9.13 packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 27 2022, 17:01:00) with Solidity and the following packages to compile and deploy the decentralized application (dapp):

* [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) - module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

* [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) - module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - Software library written for the python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

* [Path](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) - from pathlib - Object-oriented filesystem paths, Path instantiates a concrete path for the platform the code is running on.

* [getenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os%20getenv#os.getenv) - From 'os', return the value of the environment variable key if it exists, or default if it doesn’t.

* [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - Python-dotenv reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables.

* [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) - a module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format.

* [writer](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) - from csv, a writer object responsible for converting the user’s data into delimited strings on the given file-like object.

* [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json) - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format inspired by JavaScript object literal syntax; exposes an API familiar to users of the standard library marshal and pickle modules.

* [Web3](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v5/quickstart.html) - a collection of modules which contain specific functionality for the ethereum ecosystem.

* [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - a simple module/HTTP library which allows transmission of HTTP requests using Python; returns a Response Object with complete response data (content, encoding, status, etc).

* [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) - a module provides various time-related functions.

* [Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) - a module in Python defines a series of functions for generating or manipulating random integers. Python random() is a pseudo-random number generator function that generates a random float number between 0.0 and 1.0, is used by functions in the random module.

* [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix-project.org/) - Remix IDE, is a no-setup tool with a GUI for developing smart contracts.

* [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) - a private Ethereum(ETH) blockchain environment that enables emulation of the ETH blockchain to interact with smart contracts in a private blockchain

* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - a software cryptocurrency self-custodial wallet and gateway to interact with the Ethereum(ETH) blockchain and ETH blockchain decentralized applications(dapps).

* [streamlit](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/) - an all python, free, open source module that enables rapid transformation of data scripts into shareable web apps.
  
* [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) - an open-source framework to build secure smart contracts; provides security products to build, automate, and operate decentralized applications.

## *Installation of application (i.e. github clone)*

In the terminal, navigate to directory where you want to install this application from the repository and enter the following command

```python
git clone git@github.com:Billie-LS/Lucky_Bar_NFT_menu_of_surprise.git
```

---
## **Usage**

Using your web browser, to [REMIX_IDE](https://remix-project.org/) and initialize Remix Online IDE.  Then load the application from the project folder where you've installed the application:

```python
initiate the Solidity Compiler
```

In the Remix IDE, navigate to the “Deploy & Run Transactions” pane, and then make sure that “JavaScript VM” is selected as the environment
```python
Deploy & Run Transactions 
```

In the Remix IDE, Click the Deploy button to deploy the smart contract
```python
Deploy 
```
___

To use the smart contract, follow the key steps described as below:

- Clone the repository and load ***SOMETHING*** and ***SOMETHING.sol*** in Remix IDE. You may see the web console view as:

![Smart Contract](Images/App_Usage.png)

- While deploying, select Remix VM (London) as a sandbox environment.

- You may compile and deploy the smart contract to use it further.

- In order to integrate Remix IDE with MetaMask and MetaMask with Ganache, you may an article [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-set-up-ganche-with-metamask/).

- Choose 'Injected Provider - MetaMask' as a sandbox blockchain Environment to connect Remix IDE with MetaMask.
