#AI Bartender
#This program is an experimental feature which the restaurants can use to interact with their clients. The purpouse is that customers can recieve a random
#NFT, retrieved from the nft_stores.cvs file which contains the NFTS which the restaurant created. AFter, the user can caht with the bartender and place an order.
#We made our bartender to be very sassy, but the idea is that resaturants can personalize their bartenders by vhanging the prompt.
